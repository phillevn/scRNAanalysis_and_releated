# scRNAanalysis_and_releated

Here is some projects I worked in single cell RNA analysis. I did some quality control, cluster analysis, pseudo Differential Expression for single cell cluster analysis. I also did some gene set enrichment and gene pathway analysis.

In the file reproduce_GS14922.Rmd, we do some scRNAseq analysis including QC, dimension reduction and cluster analysis. Moreover, I also perform a pseudo-bulk gen Differential Expressions by using DESeq2 package. If you combine this work with the file pathway_analysis file, we have a complete pipeline to do single cell analysis from scratch to gene set enrichment analysis and gen pathwiew analysis.
